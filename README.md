# Cat's Lethal Modpack
A modpack I made for some friends, Its mostly just client side tweaks with the More Company Mod

[Game v45], Everything seems to work besides the current version of QuickTerminalRestart

Toggle Mute is a bit annoying until the author makes typing not trigger the keybind, so if you use the terminal a bunch I'd recommend disabling it

If there are updates to any of the mods, please create an issue or pull request on the [Github Page](https://github.com/JustCat80/CatsLethalModpack)
